So in the words of my clever friend Adonai . The hardest exercises you will ever have to do. Once you have done this you will have graduated from being taught programing and you will be able to start learning thing by yourself.

Essentially the exercies are :

Binary Exercise 1 
Do manually binary addition - ie if you do 111 + 111 what does it give us in binary 
No methods allowed


Binary Exercise 2
Do manually binary multiplication  - what would 111 x 111 be 
The result

Safe to say that it took me quite some times but I managed it in the end
